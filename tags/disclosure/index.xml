      <description>0x01 Introduction Around March 14th 2019 I found Local File Inclusion, Path Traversal and File Write on the Gucci subdomain glft.gucci.com on port 3443 (https://glft.gucci.com:3443/). When attempting to go to the subdomain on the regular port 80/433 you would be met with a message that the subdomain was an intranet interface. So all of the findings combined, a malicious actor could have read local files, uploaded a phishing page, upload a shell which could have led to a reverse shell, opening up a potential of traversing the internal network.</description>

      <description>0x01 Discovery Utilizing the EDD developed by @83LeeJ of CTRLBOX an initial discovery was made after we found data leaked from the LG Claims Office. Upon discussing this with fellow Underdog Security researcher Dominik Penner (@zer0pwn) and realizing that they had a vulnerability disclosure program, the decision was made to search lge.com for more issues. The first step we took was using spyse.py to generate a list of subdomains and map out the attack surface.</description>
